# GDLevelsLib

A library for creating and editing Geometry Dash levels.

- Over 1,000 lines `</>`
- Simple and easy to use
- Fun! ðŸŽ‰

## Example usage:
```python
import gdlevelslib as GD

# Create a new level
myLevel = GD.GeometryDashLevel("Example", "Example Username", "example", None, revision=0)

# Add 1'024 objects to the level
for i in range(1024):
    myLevel.add_object(GD.GeometryDashObject(1+i, i*30+15, 15, 0, None))

# Add our level to Geometry Dash
GD.add_level(myLevel)
```

> [!CAUTION]
> **GDLevelsLib** is still in alpha, so this may change!
>
> I will make sure to update the example project.

## Requirements
> Python 3.10
> Basic knowledge in programming :P
